## TODO:
- Allow AST definition to list everywhere it is used
- Allow AST to be aware of position in document
- Might want a class to wrap the base types () to handle the following methods:
  - to_json_schema
  - validate_python
  - python_to_json
  - is_null
- Figure out where to implement the combining of composite indexes ( and normalizing set indexes )
